 

As machine learning and AI propagate in software products and services, we need to establish best practices and tools to test, deploy, manage, and monitor ML models in real-world production. In short, with MLOps we strive to avoid “technical debt” in machine learning applications.

SIG MLOps defines “an optimal MLOps experience [as] one where Machine Learning assets are treated consistently with all other software assets within a CI/CD environment. Machine Learning models can be deployed alongside the services that wrap them and the services that consume them as part of a unified release process.” By codifying these practices, we hope to accelerate the adoption of ML/AI in software systems and fast delivery of intelligent software. In the following, we describe a set of important concepts in MLOps such as Iterative-Incremental Development, Automation, Continuous Deployment, Versioning, Testing, Reproducibility, and Monitoring.



随着机器学习与人工智能在软件产品和服务的普及应用，我们需要建立对模型的测试、管理、监控的工具应用于真实的生产中，使用MLOps尽力避免机器学习应用的技术债务。
